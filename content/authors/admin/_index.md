I am a bioinformatics freelancer and researcher interested in computational systems biology and data visualization. I have experience in working with large-scale biological data including, gene expression profiles and clinical datasets. I am enthusiastic about making science seen. In my opinion, data visualization is the key to the communication and growth of science in society, which led me to learn various visualization techniques.
